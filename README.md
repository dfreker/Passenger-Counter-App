# Passenger Counter App
 App developed in the first lesson of the Scrimba Learn JavaScript Course 

I am taking the Passenger Counter App which was part of the Learn JavaScript course in Scrimba. This is an introducory level JS course taught by Per Harold Borgen. In the course it was developed in a Scrim. I'm refreshing my memory with this course before moving on to the second lesson which is a Black Jack game. And, I'm getting aquainted with GitHub and GitHub Desktop in the process.
